## Hey there, I'm Akshaya!
Just a beginner who googles a lot but learns a little more each day!🙃

I am a **CSE student** passionate about **DSA** and **Web Development**.<br/>

I love blending my artistic side with tech, and I’m always excited to learn something new!<br/>
Building cool stuff makes learning fun and inspires me to create even more!
